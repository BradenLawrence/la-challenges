We've obtained some data from the NASA API  (https://data.nasa.gov/resource/64xd-c8tb.json) to learn more about
some of the companies that attended South x Southwest in 2016. Now, we want to use that data to answer some questions.

## Getting Started
```no-highlight
et get nasa-data
cd nasa-data
atom .
```

### Instructions

In this challenge, you'll write a program in `code.rb` that traverses through
the compound data structure we got back from our API call to print out some data
in a particular format and answer a series of questions.

Calling `nasa_data` will give you the whole structure to work with (i.e.
`nasa_data.each do |something|`, etc).

_**Please read through ALL the directions before beginning!**_

* Make sure you're using **logic** to get to the solutions, not hard coding the solution.

### Tips

* Use `.each`. Use it a lot!

* Break down the compound data structure into its smallest parts. Isolate a data structure and ask yourself what composes it. Is it an array of hashes? An array of strings? An array of arrays?

* Reference the Ruby docs for
  [Arrays](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Array.html),
  [Hashes](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Hash.html) and
  [Strings](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/String.html)
  to explore what methods Ruby has to offer.

### Meeting Expectations Requirements

Write code to produce the terminal output shown in each example block. (Put
another way, when you run `ruby code.rb`, your program should display all of
this data sequentially in your terminal as shown in the example output blocks.) You must use **logic** to output the answers. **No hardcoding answers**

1. Create a method called company_name that takes in two arguments, an array and a company name.The method must return the entire hash for the given company.
```
{"computed_region_cbhk_fwbd"=>17, "computed_region_nnqa_25f4"=>1237, "country"=>"USA", "domain"=>"com", "email_hosts"=>"garmin.com", "location_1"=>{"type"=>"Point", "coordinates"=>[-94.819128, 38.881396]}, "location_1_city"=>"Olathe", "location_1_state"=>"KS", "position"=>"Product Architect, Mobile & Wearable Devices"}
```
2. Create a method called location that takes in an array and returns the city and state for every company.
