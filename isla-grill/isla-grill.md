## Exercise

You're still enjoying your trip to Zetox! On the third night, you and your
team go to a delicious restaurant called the HB Grill. After a delicious meal,
a team-member asks you to write a quick Ruby program to calculate potential tips
for the waiter. The total cost of the meal was $178. They would like to know
how much tip to give for 20% of the bill. Don't worry about breaking the bill up, you're all paying together.

Start with Ruby code below:

```ruby
dinner_total = 178
tip = 0.20
```
Then, print out **both the total and the tip amount.**  

Sample output:

```no-highlight
The total bill is $213.60
You should tip $35.60
```
