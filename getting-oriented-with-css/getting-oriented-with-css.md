Time to start writing some CSS! Frequent repetition and use is the best way to solidify your CSS skills.

## Getting Started

```no-highlight
et get getting-oriented-with-css
cd getting-oriented-with-css
open index.html
```

## Learning Goals

* Loading a stylesheet into your HTML file
* Using HTML elements as CSS selectors
* Applying various font properties

### Let's Get Stylish

Once you have your index.html file open in your browser, open your dev tools. Now you can see both the un-styled HTML page and what's going on under the hood. As you work, **hard-refresh** `Command + Shift + r` this page frequently to see your changes take effect.

The included CSS file has only one style declaration - it should turn your page background purple when loaded into the HTML. Your first job is to link up these styles to the HTML page by adding a line to the `head` section of your HTML. When your reloaded browser page turns purple, you've done it right!

Once you've gotten the stylesheet successfully loaded into the page, go ahead and delete the code that's currently inside it.
**Your job is to write your own CSS that makes each page element look the proper way, as described by the text on the page.**   
Refresh the browser page after writing each block of style to make sure your styles take effect. All your changes go into the CSS file - the only change you make to the HTML file should be adding the line to load your stylesheet!

Your final product should look something like this:
