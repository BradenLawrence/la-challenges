Mary Sue, Sally Jane, and Billy Joe all ran strong campaigns for the highly coveted position of Representative to Those with First Names as Last Names. The candidates _really_ want to know who won, so they've turned to you to make sense of the results.

### Tips

* Use `.each` and use it often!
* Insert a `binding.pry` after each line of code to inspect what returns you're generating.
* Use descriptive variables that allow others to clearly understand what the values are.
* Be sure your output matches the provided sample data.

### Instructions
