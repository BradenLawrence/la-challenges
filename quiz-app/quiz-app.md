You have given your Space Exploration teams a quiz on deployment safety. Now, you need to show how the groups did. To do this, you will build a JavaScript app that will calculate and display the teams' results.

## Getting Started

From your `challenges` folder in the terminal, type the following commands:

```no-highlight
et get quiz-app
cd quiz-app
open index.html
atom .
```

> your work will go in `main.js`

In the browser, open up the JavaScript console. You can refresh the page in order to see your changes.

### Instructions

The explorers have taken the quiz and here are the results:

```no-highlight
Team 1 - JustJavaScript
Rami: 88
Natoya: 92
Max: 68
Lynn: 100

Team 2 - We Are Ruby
Sasha: 82
Mohammed: 98
Jennifer: 94
Denise: 92
```

Write some code in `main.js` which will:  

* calculate the average score for each team and for both teams together
* round the averages to the nearest integer for display  
* calculate the number of explorers passing the quiz (grade >= 70%)

> To get started, declare a variable for each person and assign their score as its value. Then, do your calculations with those variables. Finally, output the results to the `console` in a readable format.

### Submitting Your Code

Once you have completed this exercise, use the `et submit` command to submit your code from this project's folder.
