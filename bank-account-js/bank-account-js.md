Keeping track of your expenses when running an entire space fleet can get overwhelming. In this exercise, we'll model a bank account in JavaScript using the object-oriented programming design pattern.

## Getting Started

```no-highlight
et get bank-account-js
cd bank-account-js
touch BankAccount.js
```

Open the project folder in your code editor.

### Instructions

Create a class named `BankAccount`. It should take the **initial balance**
as an argument to its constructor. The bank account should store the
**transactions** made against the account. There should be a way to
**add a transaction** as well as calculate the **current balance** on the
account.

Based on this description, what instance variables do you plan to create
in your `BankAccount` class? What methods should exist?

Use the following information to create a new `BankAccount` object,
run the list of transactions against the account, and print out the
current balance.

```javascript
let initialBalance = 1000
let bills = [-45, -99.95, -34.43]
// create a new BankAccount
// print out current balance
```
