Let's build a website that shows a hidden coupon code.


## Getting Started
```no-highlight
et get coupon-code
cd coupon-code
open index.html
atom .
```

## Learning Goals
* Use event handlers in JavaScript to make a webpage respond to a user click
* Target and manipulate specific elements of the DOM

### Instructions
When you open `index.html` in your browser, you should see an add for Sunglass Shack. Your goal is to write some code such that when the user clicks `'CLICK HERE!'`, the blue `-- Coupon Code --` div displays `'50OFF-YOWZA!'` instead.

Put your JavaScript code in the provided `main.js` file. In addition, you may need to tweak the HTML or CSS provided.
