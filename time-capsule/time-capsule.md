[The Crypt of Civilization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypt_of_Civilization)
and its
[contents](http://www.oglethorpe.edu/about_us/crypt_of_civilization/inventory.asp)
are interesting and all, but what if we want to create our own Time Capsule?

## Getting Started  

From your challenges folder, type the following command:

```no-highlight
et get time-capsule
cd time-capsule
atom .  
```  

All your work should be done in the provided `code.rb` file. You can run your code in the terminal with:

```no-highlight
ruby code.rb
```

### Part 1

We can use an array to store the contents of _our_ time capsule in a variable called `time_capsule`. Write a program that does the following:

* Greet the user and take their name. Store this name.
* Ask the user what they want to add to the time capsule. Give the user an option to type the command "FINISHED" which instructs the program to stop asking the user to add more items.
* If they entered an item, store that item in the time capsule.
* Once finished, print out the contents of the time capsule.

#### Sample Output

```no-highlight
Ms. Hopper, thanks for trying our Time Capsule maker. Here is a list of the items in your Time Capsule!

* Comptometer
* Box of phonographic records
* plastic savings bank
* set of scales
* Toast-O-Lator
* sample of aluminum foil
* Donald Duck doll
```

By the way, don't worry about duplicates here! If you type the same thing in a
few times, you will see it the same number of times. For example, say you type
'Toast-O-Lator' three times in your list, you will see something like this
(depending on when you typed them in):

```no-highlight
Ms. Hopper, thanks for trying our Time Capsule maker. Here is a list of the items in your Time Capsule!:

* Toast-O-Lator
* Comptometer
* Box of phonographic records
* plastic savings bank
* Toast-O-Lator
* set of scales
* Toast-O-Lator
* sample of aluminum foil
* Donald Duck doll
```

### Part 2

Update your program from Part 1 to store a count for each item added. After
prompting a user for an item, prompt them for a number (greater than 0) of that
item. The output of your program should be the following (the number in
parentheses is the count of each respective item):

```no-highlight
Ms. Hopper, thanks for trying our Time Capsule maker. Here is a list of the items in your Time Capsule!

* Comptometer (1)
* Box of phonographic records (1)
* plastic savings bank (4)
* set of scales (1)
* Toast-O-Lator (108)
* sample of aluminum foil (3)
* Donald Duck doll (87)
```
