It's easy to lose track of time when you're floating around in space. This exercise will help you to keep the calendar correct!

## Getting Started

```no-highlight
et get leap-year-in-space
cd leap-year-in-space
atom .
```
> A leap year is a year containing one additional day in order to keep the
> calendar year synchronized with the astronomical or seasonal year.

### Instructions

Create a class named `Year` that takes one argument in its constructor method.

```javascript
let currentYear = new Year(2017)
```

Next, create a `isLeapYear` method in the `Year` class, which returns `true` or `false`.

Finally, write some code using the `Year` class to chronologically print out all the leap years in the current century. You may print this data to the console or to the DOM, your choice.
