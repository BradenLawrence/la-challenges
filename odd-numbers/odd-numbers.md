## Getting Started  

From your challenges folder, type the following command:

```no-highlight
et get odd-numbers
cd odd-numbers
atom .  
```  

All your work should be done in the provided `code.rb` file. You can run your code in the terminal with:

```no-highlight
ruby code.rb
```

### Instructions  

Write a program that prints out all of the odd numbers from 1 to 100, each
on a new line.

{% show_hint %}

- There are multiple approaches that will achieve this functionality.
- One simple approach will involve the use of a `while` loop

{% endshow_hint %}

### Sample Output

```no-highlight
