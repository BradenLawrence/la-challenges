Use your JavaScript skills to solve a real-universe problem.

## Getting Started

From your `challenges` folder in the terminal, type the following commands:

```no-highlight
et get perimeter-function-js
cd perimeter-function-js
open index.html
atom .
```

> your work will go in `main.js`

In the browser, open up the JavaScript console. You can refresh the page in order to see your changes.

### Instructions

Write a JavaScript function to calculate the perimeter of a rectangle.  

In `main.js`, write your function, then use a `console.log` to output your result.

Hint: The formula for calculating a rectangle's perimeter is as follows: `p = 2 * width + 2 * height`. With that in mind, what should your function's inputs, or arguments, be?

```no-highlight
       width
+----------------+
|                |
|                |  height
|                |
+----------------+

```

### Sample Output

```no-highlight
perimeter(3, 5)  // returns 16
```
