There's a classic jukebox at this diner, and you're dying to put together a
playlist.

As you approach the jukebox, you realize that this isn't your ordinary music playing machine!
There's a computer attached to it, and a sign above it that states "No coins,
just Ruby instances, please."

You think, "Wow, I guess software really is [eating the
world][eating-the-world]!"

### Part I - Model Your Jukebox

* Your `Jukebox` constructor should take in a playlist of songs as an argument. This playlist
represents the songs that you are _requesting_ the jukebox to play.
* Like any good jukebox,
it is limited to a certain set of songs that it can actually play. Below is the
list of songs the jukebox has to offer. Your constructor should eliminate any
songs from your _requested_ playlist that are not on this list:

```no-highlight
Hello - Lionel Ritchie
Kokomo - The Beach Boys
Girl You Know It’s True - Milli Vanilli
Agadoo - Black Lace
Down Under - Men at Work
Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now - Starship
Get Outta My Dreams, Get Into My Car - Billy Ocean
I Just Called To Say I Love You - Stevie Wonder
Hangin' Tough - New Kids on the Block
We Built This City - Starship
Wake Me Up Before You Go Go - Wham!
We Didn't Start The Fire - Billy Joel
I Wanna Dance With Somebody - Whitney Houston
U Can't Touch This - MC Hammer
```

### Part II - Shuffle Your Playlist

Implement a `shuffle_songs!` method that randomizes the order of your playlist.

### Part III - Make Sweet Music

Implement a `play!` instance method that takes the first song on the list and removes it
from the playlist permanently. Upon calling this method, the playing song should be returned in your terminal.

### Part IV - Add to Your Playlist

Implement an `add_track` instance method that requires one argument, the name of
the track. If the song is in list of available songs, your software should add
the song the the end of the playlist and return `true`. If the song is not found on
the list, it should just return `false`.

#### Hint
You can store the list of available songs in an array inside your class and declare it as a Constant.  A constant is a type of variable that is not meant to be changed.  Syntax for a constant requires it to be in all capital letters.  For instance:

```ruby
MY_CONSTANT = ['unchangeable', 'values', 'in', 'my', 'array']
```
