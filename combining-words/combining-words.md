## Getting Started

Let's do a small exercise to practice working with Ruby strings! From your challenges folder, type the following command:

```
et get combining-words
cd combining-words
atom .
```

Run this code by entering `ruby code.rb` into your terminal.  

## Exercise

While you're standing in line to be fitted for your space suit, you and your friends decide to play a game where you all tell a story, by each saying one word at a time in turn.

Practice adding together strings by writing six separate words, each wrapped in their own set of quotations, and using the plus sign to [concatenate](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/concatenate?s=t) the strings.

The resulting output should be a coherent sentence with proper formatting and syntax.

```ruby
"Today we traveled to the planet Mars and danced on the dust while listening to classic music."
```

Put the code you've written to do this in the provided `code.rb` file. Use the `puts` command at the beginning of your line of code to print your results to the command-line interface (CLI).

If you'd like to make things a little more challenging, assign your words to variables and print your string by concatenating the variables!

## Submit Your Work

From your `combining-words` folder:

```
et submit
```
