### Getting Set Up

```no-highlight
et get next-flight
cd next-flight
atom .
```

Complete your work in the `code.rb` file, and run your code in the terminal like this:
```no-highlight
ruby code.rb
```

## Instructions

Your new space flights are a huge hit - so much that you're being flooded with calls about timing. It's time to automate!
Given the following data, calculate the user's next available flight based on their input of when the earliest is that they can leave. For ease of development, use a 24 hour format where 1:15PM == 13.25.

```no-highlight
Flight 1, 2
Flight 2, 5
Flight 3, 7.5
Flight 4, 8.5
Flight 5, 9
Flight 6, 10
Flight 7, 11.5
Flight 8, 13.5
Flight 9, 14.5
Flight 10, 17
Flight 11, 18
Flight 12, 19
Flight 13, 24
```

_When the user specifies a time that they want to leave Earth, the system should inform them of the next available flight_

## Meeting Expectations Requirements

* Write Ruby code that implements the following sample run of the program:

Sample Run:

```no-highlight
ruby code.rb
What time are you leaving?
> 12.5
You should catch Flight 8 leaving at 13.5
```

### Tips

* The simplest way to store the timetable would be as an array of times.
* Remember that elements within an array are accessed via a 0-based index.
* Expect that the traveler will enter their time in decimal format. eg- `11.25` instead of `11:15AM`.
* To get the flight number, add one to the index
* **DO NOT** start the requirements necessary to Exceed Expectations until you have completed the requirements necessary to Meet Expectations. Remember to `et submit` after Meeting expectations - it's okay to submit more than once!

## Optional Challenges

* Handle bad traveler input. Any input that is not a number should prompt the traveler to re-enter the data. For example, after running `ruby code.rb`:

```no-highlight
What time are you leaving?
> abcd
Sorry, I don't understand that time.

What time are you leaving?
>
```

* Simulate the following output if the user should catch Flight 13.

```no-highlight
As a space traveler taking the midnight flight who also _loves_ Journey
I want to see the lyrics from Journey's masterpiece "Don't Stop Believin'"
So that I can sing along
```

_When the system identifies the midnight flight as the next available flight, the user should be presented with the lyrics from "Don't Stop Believin'"_


#### Sample Run:

```no-highlight
$ ruby code.rb
What time are you leaving?
> 22
You should catch Flight 13 leaving at 24

***DON'T STOP...BELIEVIN'!***

Just a small town girl
Living in a lonely world
She took the midnight train going anywhere
Just a city boy
Born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train going anywhere

A singer in a smoky room
A smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers waiting, up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching in the night
Streetlights people, living just to find emotion
Hiding, somewhere in the night.
```
