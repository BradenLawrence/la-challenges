### Introduction

Re-create this fortune telling toy in ruby!

### Learning Goals

* Work with the Array data structure
* Calling methods on Arrays

### Getting Started  

From your challenges folder, type the following command:

```no-highlight
et get magic-8-ball
cd magic-8-ball
atom .  
```  

All your work should be done in the provided `code.rb` file. You can run your code in the terminal with:

```no-highlight
ruby code.rb
```

### Work that Magic

Using your knowledge of arrays thus far and past articles as a reference, complete the following using the included `responses` array in `code.rb`.
Take each step one at a time to break it down into smaller problems to solve!

* Confirm the correct number of responses have been stored by printing the number to the console (`20`)
* Ask the user what their question is, and store it as a variable called `question`  
* Output a random response to the user's question
* Output the number of responses that include the word "yes"
* Output the number of responses that include the words "no" or "not"
* Output the alphabetized list of responses  
* Output the first and last responses from the alphabetized list  
* Add 1 response of your choosing to the current list
* Concat an **array** of 3 additional responses to the current list  
* Confirm the correct number of responses have been stored by printing the number to the console (`24`)
