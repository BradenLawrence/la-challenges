# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Example:
#
Ship.create(
  name: 'USS Enterprise',
  ship_class: 'Galaxy',
  location: "Romulan Star Empire"
)
Ship.create(
  name: 'Serenity',
  ship_class: 'Firefly',
  location: "Miranda"
)
