## Getting Started

From your `challenges` folder in the terminal, type the following commands:

```no-highlight
et get street-show
cd street-show
```

To run your code,

```no-highlight
ruby code.rb
```

## Exercise

In your on-going quest to keep the space crew from getting bored on long trips, you'll be hiring some local street performers to go along with them on the next flight. The performers have invited you to see them in action. What they don't know is you've got some crazy awesome circus tricks up your own sleeve! You're hoping to earn some tips of your own so you can pay for their trips with your crew.

To find out which of _your_ skills will make you the most cash, you've written a Ruby program to automatically record each tip you get based on which trick you do! Now that you have that information, time to look at what was most successful.

Here are the tips you got while performing each trick:

Knife Juggling
- $2.10
- $0.77
- $5.00
- $1.00
- $3.00

Torch Juggling
- $6.00
- $3.50
- $7.00

Hand Balancing
- $2.00
- $1.00

Human Blockhead - [(Human what now?)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Blockhead)
- $0.75
- $0.43

## Remember: Use the `format` method

Recall from previous assignments that you can use the `format` method to properly format floating point numbers and return a string.

```no-highlight
format(places_to_round, number_to_round)
```

The code example below will round the numeric value PI to 2 decimal places, and return it as a `String` instance.

```ruby
format("%.2f", Math::PI)
=> "3.14"
```

Open up IRB and try out each line below. How are the returns different?

```ruby
format("%.2f", 2.7125)
format("%.2f", 2.7125).to_i
format("%.2f", 2.7125).to_f
```

## Part 1

First, let's calculate the total that you've made from each trick. For each trick, write a line of Ruby code that calculates the sum of your tips and saves the result as a variable. Then print a summary of your totals to the terminal window using `puts`, as so:

```no-highlight
Knife Juggling:
11.87
Torch Juggling:
16.5
Hand Balancing:
3.00
Human Blockhead:
1.18
```

Next, write a line of code that calculates and prints your total income:

```no-highlight
Total:
32.55
```

Last of all, you want to learn the [Average](https://www.mathsisfun.com/definitions/average.html) amount of each tip. Find the average by using the variables you set earlier on to calculate the total sum, and then divide by the number of tips you've received. Print your result to the terminal window:

```no-highlight
Average Tip Value:
2.7125
```

## Part 2

You've decided to up your street-performing game by adding in some audience participation - and doing it via Ruby code! Everyone will surely go wild about the one-and-only Ruby-programmed street show. Write some lines of code that achieve the following steps:

- Ask for an audience volunteer.
- Ask the volunteer's name.
- Accept the user's input and save it as a variable.
- Ask the audience to provide a big round of applause for the volunteer, referencing them by the provided name.
- Ask what the volunteer's favorite number is.
- Accept the user's input and save it as a variable.
- State that you and your friend will juggle these knives around the volunteer for a certain number of seconds, where the number of seconds is equal to the volunteer's favorite number.

Example Output:
*(Exact wording is up to you!)*

```no-highlight
Hello everybody! Today, I will be showing you acts of great daring. Can I have an audience volunteer?
There's our brave volunteer! What's your name?
> Casi
Everyone give a big round of applause for Casi!
Now Casi, what's your favorite number?
> 23
Alright Casi, my friend and I will be juggling these knives around you for 23 seconds. Are you prepared to be amazed?
```
