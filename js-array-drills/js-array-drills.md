Practice working with arrays in JavaScript!

## Getting Started
```no-highlight
et get js-array-drills
cd js-array-drills
atom .
open index.html
```

>Your work should go in the `main.js` file

### Instructions

You've been provided with two arrays in the `main.js` file. The first array is a list of teachers. The second is a list of rooms, and each room contains student names.

**The index of the teacher correlates to the room of students they teach.** That is, if teacher Arrington is at `teachers[0]` then the room she teaches is `rooms[0]`.

The functions have already been set up for you. Your job is to complete them to return the information requested. The instructions are also commented for you in the `main.js` file.

* List all the teachers with an even index number (including 0)

* List all of the teachers with the letter i in their name

* Return the number of teachers

* Return the number of rooms of students

* Return the number of students in all the rooms

* Return the students who have an i in their names

* Return the teacher who has the given student in their room
