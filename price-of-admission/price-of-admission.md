## Getting Started

From your `challenges` folder in the terminal, type the following commands:

```no-highlight
et get price-of-admission
cd price-of-admission
atom .
```

## The Exercise
You're working on a program that calculates the total admission costs for people wishing to go on one of your public space flight tours. A family of 6 consisting of 4 adults and 2 children has requested a price check prior to purchasing.

Admission prices are marked on the sign:

```no-highlight
---------------------
| ADULTS: $120.80    |
| CHILDREN: $40.00   |
---------------------
```

Write a line of code in the provided `code.rb` file that calculates the total cost for the family of six to get onto a flight.

This exercise is intended to be quite short. Your program should simply use the `puts` keyword to output the calculated value:

```no-highlight
563.20
```

### Bonus:

To calculate how much each adult should pay, write a line of code that
both calculates the above sum and then splits it evenly between the
four adults. Output the cost per adult. Include this code in your `code.rb` file!

#### A Brief Digression on Floating Point Numbers and Formatting

The way most programming languages store numbers with decimals can be quite problematic! It is actually _hard_ for computers to store exact values when it comes to mathematically complex numbers.

For example, let's open up IRB and take a look at the mathematical value, *PI*.

```no-highlight
Math::PI
=> 3.141592653589793
```

Going back to our Geometry class days, we know that the number PI goes on and on for millions of digits. [pi-million](http://www.piday.org/million/).

What if we want to only show two digits after the decimal? We have two options.

```no-highlight
Math::PI.round(2)
=> 3.14
```

In this example, the `round` method will round the number to the nearest 2nd decimal place.

```no-highlight
Math::PI.round(3)
=> 3.142
```

This change rounds "up" to the nearest 3rd decimal place, given the 4th decimal place is a `5`. Note, too, that the `round` method returns a new `Fixnum` and not a string.

If we wish to return a string, we can use a different approach, through the use of a `format` method call. You can check out the [Format Documentation](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Kernel.html#method-i-format) for further information, but here's how we're using it:

```no-highlight
format(places_to_round, number_to_round)
```

So if we were to round Pi to three places, we could do:

```no-highlight
format("%.3f", Math::PI)
=> "3.142"
```

This `format` call will still round, but it will return a **String**-based representation of the number.

We can also use the `format` method to round to 2 decimal places.  

```no-highlight
format("%.2f", Math::PI)
=> "3.14"
```

For your implementation of this challenge, use the `format` method.

## Before You Move On

Submit the code you wrote! Run `et submit` from the `price-of-admission` directory. The `et` gem will grab the whole folder and upload it to Horizon.
You'll do this a lot, so if you're having trouble with `et`, please reach out for help from other students or staff on Slack.
