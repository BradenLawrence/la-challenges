# As an errant slacker
# I want to see a random article
# So that I can spend less time choosing which article to read
#
# Acceptance Criteria:
# [ ] When I visit /random it has a button with the text "Random Button".
# [ ] When the button is clicked, a fetch call should generate a request to an API endpoint on the Sinatra backend
# [ ] The API endpoint should return a random article as a response, and that article's information will need to append to the page.
