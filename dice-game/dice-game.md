## Getting Started  

From your challenges folder, type the following command:

```no-highlight
et get dice-game
cd dice-game
atom .  
```  

All your work should be done in the provided `dice.rb` file. You can run your code in the terminal with:

```no-highlight
ruby dice.rb
```

### Instructions

A common need from your team is games to help pass the time. The lack of gravity means their dice always float off mid-game. Build them a Ruby program that simulates rolling a pair (2) of dice.


### Sample Run

Running `ruby dice.rb` should result in output that looks like the following:

```no-highlight
You rolled a 1 and a 5
Total: 6
Press 'Enter' to roll again, 'S' to stop

You rolled a 5 and a 6
Total: 11
Press 'Enter' to roll again, 'S' to stop

You rolled a 2 and a 6
Total: 8
Press 'Enter' to roll again, 'S' to stop

You rolled a 2 and a 1
Total: 3
Press 'Enter' to roll again, 'S' to stop
S
```


### Advanced Dice Roller (optional)

Ask the user how many sides their dice have and how many times they would like
to roll their pair of dice.


### Sample Run

```no-highlight
How many sides does your dice have?
20
How many times would you like to roll your pair of dice?

You rolled a 15 and a 5. Total: 20
