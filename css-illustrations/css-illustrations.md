Time to put all that new knowledge to work! You now have a lot of the tools that you need to be totally controlling the look of your elements - and even make completely empty elements take up space on the page.

### Making an Illustration with CSS

In this exercise, your job is to use your new skills to create an illustration of a tree - using only CSS! Your final outcome should look like so:

### Instructions

An HTML file has been provided to get you started. It contains a number of empty `divs`, with class names pre-assigned. You should **not have to edit the HTML** at all - your task is to write the CSS required to make those empty `divs` display as the correct width, height, color, and spacing! This will involve the following steps (in no particular order):

- Making all branches a certain height, background-color, and border-radius
- Making each individual branch a specific width
- Making the trunk of the tree a certain width, height, background-color, and border-radius
- Assign some vertical margin to all layers so that they have space between them

### Tips

- Start by looking at the HTML to see how the page is structured, what the relevant class names are, and which elements you'll be selecting for what purposes.
- Try to avoid repeating yourself too much in your CSS. Take advantage of repeated class names in the HTML to assign styling to whole sets of elements!
