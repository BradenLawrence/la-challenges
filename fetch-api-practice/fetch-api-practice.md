## Apply your understanding of Fetch!

Now that you have become familiar with some of the utility of fetch, build on the work you did during the [ES6 Fetch API](https://learn.launchacademy.com/lessons/es6-fetch-api) walkthrough.


## Instructions:

Begin by running:
```
et get fetch-api-practice
bundle install
ruby server.rb
```

The data has already been fetched from its source.  Your job is to:
1. Create a new list item for each book title.
2. Append each list item to the unordered list on the index page.

## Tips:

* Check out the `index.erb` to see what your page looks like.
* Use your knowledge of Javascript to access the `innerHTML` on the page.  (Think back to DOM Manipulation and `.getElementById`.)
